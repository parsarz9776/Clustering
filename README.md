# Clustering
#A company plans on investing in a project. 
#As a machine learning expert you will provide your advice to the company as to which of the following they should invest in:
#a.	Coffee store (such as Tim Hortons or Williams)
#b.	Pizza store (such as Pizza Pizza or Dominos Pizza)
#c.	Chicken store (such KFC or Popeyes)
#d.	Burger store (such as McDonald's or Burger King)
#e.	Restaurant (such as KEG or Swiss Chalet)
#You should select one of the above based on good reasons such as the overall profits ( consider number of workers, cost of rent, location, food cost, extra martials, ... etc.) 
#An example is to select to open pizza store then you should address the followings: 
#What do you think would be the possible challenges? 
#The need to analyse the areas from where the pizza is being ordered frequently. 
#The need to understand how many pizza stores must be opened to cover delivery in the area. The need to figure out the locations for the pizza stores within all these areas in order to keep the distance between the store and delivery points minimum. 
#Resolving these challenges includes a lot of analysis and mathematics. It is important to learn about how clustering can provide a meaningful and easy method of sorting out such real-life challenges. 
#What would be a good clustering algorithm to solve this problem. 
#Write your code to implement this algorithm.
